// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here
//- 3 times
// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:
// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
//- 0

// c) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
//- "00"
// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
//- 1, remainingSeconds is 1 because 61 % 60 = 1. The last call is pad(remainingSeconds) so pad(1) makes num = 1.

// e) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
//- "01" , num.toString() changes 1 into "1". Since "1" has only 1 character, the while loop adds "0" in front, making "01".
